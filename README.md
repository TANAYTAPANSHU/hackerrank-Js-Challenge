# I am working on the 10 days of javascript challenge to get expertise on Js üë®‚Äçüíª ‚ú®



# Day-0

## Task : Variables named firstInteger,firstDecimal and firstString are declared for you in the editor
<ol>
<li> Convert to an integer (Number type), then sum it with and print the
  result on a new line using console.log .</li>
<li> Convert to a floating-point number (Number type), then sum it with
  and print the result on a new line using console.log .</li>
<li> Print the concatenation of and on a new line using console.log . Note
  that must be printed first.</li>
  </ol>
  
  
###  Input Format

Data Type Parameter Description
string The string representation of an integer you must sum with .
string The string representation of a floating-point number you must sum with
.
string A string of one or more space-separated words you must append to .
Output Format
Print the following three lines of output:
1. On the first line, print the sum of and the integer representation of .
2. On the second line, print the sum of and the floating-point representation of
.
3. On the third line, print concatenated with . You must print
before .


# Day-1  Arithmetic Operators

## Task

Complete the following functions in the editor below:
1. getArea(length, width): Calculate and return the area of a rectangle having sides and .
2. getPerimeter(length, width) : Calculate and return the perimeter of a rectangle having sides
and .
The values returned by these functions are printed to stdout by locked stub code in the editor.

# Day-1 Functions

## Task

Implement a function named factorial that has one parameter: an integer,n . It must return the value of
n!(i.e. n factorial).
Input Format
Locked stub code in the editor reads a single integer,n , from stdin and passes it to a function named
factorial.
Constraints
Output Format
The function must return the value of n! .

# Day-1 Let and Const

## Task

1. Declare a constant variable,PI , and assign it the value Math.PI. You will not pass this challenge
unless the variable is declared as a constant and named PI (uppercase).
2. Read a number,r, denoting the radius of a circle from stdin.
3. Use PI and r to calculate the and of a circle having radius .
4. Print area as the first line of output and print perimeter as the second line of output

# Day-2 Conditional Statements: If-Else

## Task 

Complete the getGrade(score) function in the editor. It has one parameter: an integer, score, denoting the number of points Julia earned on an exam. It must return the letter corresponding to her Grade. 

# Day-2  Conditional Statements: Switch

## Task

Complete the getLetter(s) function in the editor. It has one parameter: a string, , consisting of lowercase English alphabetic letters (i.e., a through z). It must return A, B, C, or D depending on the following criteria:

If the first character in string s is in the set {a,e,i,o,u} , then return A.
If the first character in string s is in the set {b,c,d,f,g}, then return B.
If the first character in string s is in the set {h,j,k,l,m} , then return C.
If the first character in string s is in the set {n,p,q,r,s,t,v,w,x,y,z} , then return D.

# Day-2 Loops

## Task

Complete the vowelsAndConsonants function in the editor below. It has one parameter, a string, , consisting of lowercase English alphabetic letters (i.e., a through z). The function must do the following:

1.>First, print each vowel in s on a new line. The English vowels are a, e, i, o, and u, and each vowel must be printed in the same order as it appeared in .
2.>Second, print each consonant (i.e., non-vowel) in s on a new line in the same order as it appeared in .

# Day-3 Arrays

## Task

Complete the getSecondLargest function in the editor below. It has one parameter: an array,nums , of n numbers. The function must find and return the second largest number in nums .


# Day-3 Arrays

## Task

Complete the reverseString function; it has one parameter,s . You must perform the following actions:

Try to reverse string s using the split, reverse, and join methods.
If an exception is thrown, catch it and print the contents of the exception's message on a new line.
Print s on a new line. If no exception was thrown, then this should be the reversed string; if an exception was thrown, this should be the original string.
